# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory(customer-portal), you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Note:
I used a public API to fetch photos, but it has a limit. Once the limit is reached, the images won't be displayed, so I implemented logic to show a placeholder for the images instead.
